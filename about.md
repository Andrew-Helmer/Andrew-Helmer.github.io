Hi there! I'm a programmer who's really interested in computer graphics (especially rendering) and statistics (especially data visualization and experimental analysis). Recently I've been doing a lot of work on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling for computer graphics. I started this blog to hopefully share or explain some things that I thought might be cool or useful to others.

I'm also really into landscape photography, with a passion for deep wilderness. You can check out my landscape photography at [andrewhelmer.com/photography](https://andrewhelmer.com/photography). On that site I also have [a blog](https://andrewhelmer.com/blog) that's more for non-programming stuff, especially photography and hiking (at least I hope I'll write more about hiking).

If you want to get in touch with me, you can [email me via a form on my site](https://andrewhelmer.com/contact), [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-helmer/), or [Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/AndrewHelmer47).
